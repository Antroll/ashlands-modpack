### Dificulty increase

Since I'm adding new items to the game that can make it easier, I'm also adding mods that increase the difficulty of the game.

- __Creature Level and Loot Control__
  Allows you to control the level of creatures in the world and the loot they drop. This mode is used to increase the difficulty of the game. Also, it can add stars and special attributes to bosses if you enable it in the config file.

- __Epic Boss Fights__
  Adds new abilities to bosses and makes them harder to kill.

### Monsters and Creatures

- __Monstrum__
  Adds new creatures to the world.

- __RtDOcean__
  Adds new creatures to the ocean. Also, it adds corals and vegetation to the ocean floor.

- __yggdrahsbetterhorse__
  Adds new horses to the game.
