# Ashlands Modpack

This is a modpack for Valheim Ashlands version. The main goal of this modpack is to not break the game balance and add new content to the game.
I like transmog systems in games, so I've added a mod that allows you to transmog your armor and weapons. I've also created a small website with the armors screenshots. You can check it [here](https://my-valheim.vercel.app). It can be useful if you want to know how the armor looks before crafting it.

## What this modpack does

### Loot

- __Jewerly Crafting__ - Adds new crystals to the world that can be mined and used to craft gems. These gems can be inserted into your weapons and armor to add new stats or improve existing ones.
  - __Soulcatcher_JC_KG_Additions__ - Adds ability to catch souls from creatures and use them to craft gems.
  - __MidnightMods-EpicJewels__ - Adds more gems to the game.

- __Valheim Enchantment System__ - Adds a new enchantment system to the game. You can enchant your weapons and armor with new scrolls that can be found in the world. Also, you can craft them using the new crafting station. (Hello LineAge 2)

### Dificulty increase

Since I'm adding new items to the game that can make it easier, I'm also adding mods that increase the difficulty of the game.

- __Creature Level and Loot Control__ - Allows you to control the level of creatures in the world and the loot they drop. This mode is used to increase the difficulty of the game. Also, it can add stars and special attributes to bosses if you enable it in the config file.

- __Epic Boss Fights__ - Adds new abilities to bosses and makes them harder to kill.

### Monsters and Creatures

- __Monstrum__ - Adds new creatures to the world.

- __yggdrahsbetterhorse__ - Adds new horses to the game.

- __humanoidRandomizer__ - randomizes the humanoid creatures in the game. It also adds new attacks and abilities to them.
