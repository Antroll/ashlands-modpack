# Ashlands Modpack

This is a modpack for Bog Witch version. The main goal of this modpack is to not break the game balance and add new content to the game.

I like transmog systems in games, so I've added a mod that allows you to transmog your armor and weapons. I've also created a small website with the armors screenshots. You can check it [here](https://my-valheim.vercel.app). It can be useful if you want to know how the armor looks before crafting it.
